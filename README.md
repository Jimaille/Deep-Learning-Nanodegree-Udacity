# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity

This a list of projects that I did during the Deep Learning Nanodegree offered by Udacity. I really enjoyed this course and I don't regret a single penny that I spent on it. The courses were great and amazingly well explained, the projects were really exciting and explored some really deep concepts. I already see the benefit of this course in my current job at Dyson and in the business project that I am currently working on.
